#
# The data follows the standard JSON format and will be further processed into a row of integers to feed the respective
# criterion formula to be rendered. There are three different categories of values that can be supplied via an object
# with the following fields: "literals", "decimal_exponents" and "marked_values".
#
# Literals are as string declared integers in an array whose notation can be made better readable by use of underscores.
#
# Decimal exponents are plain integers in an array and represent powers of a ten.
#
# Marked values come as objects with two fields: "value" and "label", both expecting string values. The "value" field
# also accepts underscores in the integers supplied.
#
# If the same value has been defined by any of the other categories, marked values will replace them with no conflict.
