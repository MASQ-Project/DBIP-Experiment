# These values follow the standard JSON format and will be processed into a coherent set of inputs to feed the respective
# criterion formula in the test. There are three different categories of values that can be supplied this way:
# "literals", "decimal_exponents" and "marked_values".
#
# Every value is allowed to incorporate an underscore ("_") for easier distinguishing numeral orders.
#
# First two come as name-value pairs with values in an array.
#
# Marked values come as objects with two fields: "value" and "label".
# If the same value has been defined by any of the other categories, marked values will replace them with no conflict.
#
# At least one category must be supplied while not empty at a time.
