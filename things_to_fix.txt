* Maybe allow `setup --mapping-protocol`
* Sometimes, mapping protocol can be set in the database, yet a setup command in masq doesn't show it.
* Turn off setup logging in setup_reporter.rs
* Remove logging of right_home_dir, wrong_home_dir, etc.
* Modify Daemon not to use Automap. If the user doesn't set up --ip, then pass no --ip to the Node and let it use
Automap. --ip should no longer be required.
