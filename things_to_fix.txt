* multinode_integration_tests won't build
* todos in node_configurator_standard.rs
* In compute_mapping_protocol_opt(), don't save the mapping protocol if it's None
* Maybe allow `setup --mapping-protocol NONE` or `setup --mapping-protocol`
* Sometimes, mapping protocol can be set in the database, yet a setup command in masq doesn't show it.
